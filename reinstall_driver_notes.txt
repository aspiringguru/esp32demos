Completed the uninstall instructions below, no joy - the uninstall appears to be complete, reinstallation still fails to produce a working install. Have tried the usual reboot neccessary on a windows machine.

grep -nw '.' -e 'CP210'
grep -nw '/c/Windows/INF' -e 'CP210'

findstr pattern  filename
findstr CP210  OEM*.inf

found in multiple lines in OEM52.inf
remove OEM52.inf & OEM52.PNF

other useful(?) tip found during digging
cmd prompt
cd c:\
SET DEVMGR_SHOW_NONPRESENT_DEVICES=1
DEVMGMT.MSC   (this opens device manager)
device manager > menu > view > show hidden devices
this shows 'hidden devices' as greyed out listings in device manager.

[1: had this working nicely until unknown issues caused drivers to disappear when checked under device manager]
