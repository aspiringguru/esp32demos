should see output from the arduino sketch line
Serial.println("The device started, now you can pair it with bluetooth!");

on android phone, open the serial bluetooth monitor app.
turn on bluetooth in android settings
pair with the ESP32 device - should see the device name 'ESP32test' as set by the arduino sketch.
in the serial bluetooth monitor app terminal (hamburger icon top left > terminal)
can type text in the arduino serial monitor, it will be returned in the android bluetooth serial terminal.
